# HTTP and streaming API

The FastAPI sidecar serves JSON HTTP routes under `/api`, Prometheus metrics at
`/metrics`, Server-Sent Events for turn/file streams, and WebSockets for
terminal/browser relays. The running build exposes the exact schema at
`/openapi.json` and interactive FastAPI documentation at `/docs`.

## Authentication

When desktop or access-key authentication is configured, send:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Raw media/download navigations may use `?_token=<token>`; middleware removes the
token from the downstream query string to reduce logging exposure. Live/ready
health, metrics and static SPA assets are exempt. WebBridge pairing/relay routes
use narrower scoped credentials where documented by their schemas.

An unconfigured loopback CLI server keeps token middleware disabled. LAN or
external deployments should configure an access key and restrictive CORS.

## Route families

| Prefix | Responsibility | Primary router |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/health` | liveness, readiness and bounded diagnostics | `health.py` |
| `/api/diagnostics` | runtime/platform/path diagnostics | `diagnostics.py` |
| `/api/remote-use` | Tailscale Serve remote access: status, serve control, session lock | `remote_use.py` |
| `/api/team` | chat, sessions, files, terminal, projects and Coding workbench | `routes/team/` |
| `/api/team/webbridge` | pairing, browser-panel chat, relay, bindings and Teach | `team/webbridge.py` |
| `/api/agents` | agent registry and editable/runtime configuration | `agents.py` |
| `/api/skills` | Skill discovery, bundle CRUD and on/off switch | `skills.py` |
| `/api/mcp` | global/plugin server status and global MCP lifecycle | `mcp.py` |
| `/api/plugins` | package inspection/install/editor/credentials/lifecycle, marketplace sources/catalogs, prepared previews and marketplace installs | `plugins.py` |
| `/api/settings` | providers, sandbox, Git, browser, Computer App Control and Conductor | `settings.py` |
| `/api/scheduler` | task CRUD, pause/resume and trigger | `scheduler.py` |
| `/api/wiki` | validated Markdown tree/file operations | `wiki.py` |
| `/api/dream` | config, manual run/status and lint | `dream.py` |
| `/api/observability` | aggregates including cache read/write token classes, trace pages and trace detail | `observability.py` |
| `/api/commands` | slash-command catalogue/rendering | `commands.py` |
| `/api/snippets` | snippet catalogue/rendering | `snippets.py` |
| `/api/auth` | provider OAuth login/callback | `auth.py` |
| `/api/quote` | cached quote-of-the-day | `quote.py` |

Plugin marketplace routes add/list/remove sources, sync and search catalogs,
prepare an install preview, and install that preview. `allow_partial` is explicit
and defaults to `false`; the server refuses a preview with unsupported
components until consent is supplied. Marketplace installs are disabled by
default and use the same trust-review lifecycle as local packages. Request and
response details are defined in the generated OpenAPI schema.

## Team subresources

The `/api/team` router includes:

- accepted chat/command ingress and per-session SSE;
- session CRUD, history, metadata, duplicate, queue, goal and todos;
- mode-scoped `GET /api/team/leads`, session-aware `GET /api/team/agents`, and
  idle-only `PATCH /api/team/sessions/{session_id}/lead` selection;
- Work folders and shared-folder context;
- workspace files/uploads/media/previews and file-watch SSE;
- Coding projects, workspace authorization/tree/files and worktrees;
- Git, Git AI, code reviews and Git server connections;
- ChangeSets, editor actions/context, LSP/language-server and Problems;
- terminal and direct-browser WebSockets;
- managed processes and `preview` dev-server targets/start/stop;
- Side Chat messages and stream;
- command-palette search: workspace-scoped
  `POST /api/team/workspace/search-everywhere` and application-wide
  `POST /api/team/search-app`.

Use the OpenAPI document rather than copying request/response field definitions
from this overview.

## Remote use

Remote access over embedded Tailscale or external Tailscale Serve lives under
`/api/remote-use` (`app/api/routes/remote_use.py`). All routes return one
payload:

```json
{
  "tailscale": {"installed": true, "logged_in": true, "https_certs": true, "error": null},
  "serve": {"enabled": true, "url": "https://machine.tailnet-example.ts.net"},
  "lock": {"user_login": "[EMAIL_6]", "device_label": "phone", "claimed_at": "...", "last_seen_at": "..."}
}
```

| Route | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /status` | Tailscale + serve state and the current lock holder (`lock` is `null` when unlocked) |
| `POST /bootstrap` | Start the bundled tsnet helper and restore persisted phone access |
| `POST /connect` | Start interactive login and return `tailscale.auth_url` |
| `POST /enable` | Runs `tailscale serve --bg http://127.0.0.1:<sidecar-port>` — port comes from the ASGI server scope, falling back to `API_PORT` |
| `POST /disable` | Runs `tailscale serve reset` |
| `POST /release` | Desktop force-release: retires every live remote session |

`tailscale.https_certs` is tri-state: `true`/`false` when the CLI gives
evidence, `null` when unknown. `tailscale.error` carries the first
user-facing CLI failure (missing binary, not logged in, HTTPS certs
unenabled, unparseable JSON). `serve.url` is the tailnet HTTPS origin when
serve is active.

Packaged desktop responses additionally include
`tailscale.provider = "embedded"` and `tailscale.auth_url`. Embedded enable
starts the bundled tsnet listener and falls back to HTTP inside the encrypted
tailnet when HTTPS certificates are unavailable. External deployments keep
the CLI behavior described above.

**Identity.** Embedded mode resolves the peer through Tailscale `WhoIs` and
forwards a signed `Tailscale-User-Login` header. External Serve mode receives
the equivalent header from `tailscaled`. The request is attributed as a remote
tailnet session and does not require the desktop bearer token. The first API
or WebSocket request from a device claims the single-device session lock;
while another session holds it, API requests from a second device fail with
HTTP 409:

```json
{
  "detail": "remote session lock is held by [EMAIL_6] (phone)",
  "current": {"user_login": "[EMAIL_6]", "device_label": "phone", "claimed_at": "...", "last_seen_at": "..."},
  "live_window_minutes": 30
}
```

An optional `X-EvoFlux-Device-Label` header names the device (the
`User-Agent` is the fallback). Sessions idle for 30 minutes are released
automatically and never block the next claim. See
[Remote use](../features/remote-use.md) for states and trust notes.

## Asynchronous chat contract

Chat/command endpoints normally return `202 Accepted` after validation and
queueing. Subscribe to `GET /api/team/{session_id}/stream` for live output and
load history for reconnect. Side Chat and browser-panel chat have separate
stream endpoints.

The SSE `data` payload is a structured envelope. Event types include content
deltas, tool/activity blocks, member status, permissions,
questions, queues, usage, goal updates, errors and completion. Clients
must tolerate additional event fields/types and reconnect using durable history
rather than assuming one uninterrupted socket.

## WebSockets

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/api/team/{session_id}/terminal` | bidirectional PTY input/output/resize |
| `/api/team/{session_id}/browser/agent` | direct browser agent commands |
| `/api/team/{session_id}/browser/presence` | visible browser mount/presence |
| `/api/team/{session_id}/computer/agent` | Computer App Control commands relayed to the Windows or macOS desktop shell |
| `/api/team/{session_id}/computer/closed` | POST: the user closed the chat's app preview card; `computer_app` refuses to attach until the turn ends |
| `/api/team/webbridge/relay` | extension relay |
| `/api/team/webbridge/agent/{session_id}` | external browser-agent relay |

WebSocket authentication is validated at the endpoint because HTTP middleware
does not wrap the upgraded channel. Protocols are versioned where the desktop
or extension advertises capabilities.

## Error and pagination conventions

Validation errors use FastAPI/Pydantic `422`; missing resources use `404`;
authorization/policy conflicts use `401`, `403` or `409`; database admission may
surface retryable `503 database_busy`. Long lists use explicit `limit`,
`offset` or cursor fields and include a next/has-next indicator.

Never depend on provider-specific raw payloads: Git reviews, model providers,
MCP and agent streams expose normalized EvoFlux schemas.
