//! Mirrors `packages/agent/src/types.ts::AgentEvent` — the lifecycle events the
//! agent loop emits. Carried over a `broadcast::Sender<AgentEvent>` so multiple
//! subscribers each get their own copy; payloads are `Arc`-wrapped where they
//! are large to keep broadcast clones cheap.
//!
//! The TS `AgentEvent` is a discriminated union on `type`. We model it as a
//! tagged enum. It is `Debug + Clone` only — `AgentEvent` is not serialized
//! across the wire (session persistence stores `AgentMessage`s, not events);
//! tests compare event sequences via `Debug`. This avoids requiring
//! `Deserialize` on `AssistantMessageEvent` (which is stream-protocol-only).
