//! Stable `#[repr(C)]` ABI contract for evo **Rust-native (cdylib) plugins**.
//!
//! evo loads extensions as compiled Rust cdylibs (`.dll`/`.so`/`.dylib`) via
//! `libloading` — **not** TS/jiti. Because we control both sides, the plugin is
//! Rust, but the *boundary* is still a hand-defined C ABI: the two sides may be
//! compiled with different Rust versions / crate versions, so no Rust type with
//! a non-`C` repr or a `Drop` impl may cross. This crate defines exactly those
//! crossing types and the registration contract.
//!
//! ## Soundness rules (load-bearing — verified by an adversarial review)
//!
//! 1. **Every crossing type is `#[repr(C)]`.** Enums used in unions carry
//!    `#[repr(u32)]` so the discriminant width is pinned.
//! 2. **No `Drop` type crosses.** `Vec`/`String`/`serde_json::Value`/`Option` of
//!    those / `Result` never appear in the ABI. Owned data crosses as
//!    [`StbString`] (ptr+len) with an **explicit `free_string`** the producer
//!    exports. [`StbString`] is `Copy` (raw pointers are `Copy`); copying
//!    duplicates the *pointer*, not the allocation, so each allocation is freed
//!    **exactly once** by the side that received it (see [`StbString`] docs).
//! 3. **Owned → JSON round-trip.** Structured host data ([`StableJsonValue`],
//!    tool params, `AgentToolResult`, events) crosses as a JSON string in a
//!    [`StbString`]. `serde_json` with `preserve_order` + `arbitrary_precision`
//!    must be enabled **consistently on host AND plugin** or integers >
//!    `u64`/`i64` lose precision and object keys may reorder — documented as a
//!    an ABI-wide limit. Tool args from the model rarely carry overflow ints, but it is
//!    never silent.
//! 4. **Unions are all-`Copy` payloads.** [`EventPayload`] / [`StepResultPayload`]
//!    variants are `#[repr(C)]` structs of primitives or [`StbString`] only, so
//!    the union is `Copy`-able and a wrong-variant read is `unsafe` (caller
//!    discriminates by `tag`).
//! 5. **Unwinding never crosses the ABI.** Every host→plugin and plugin→host
//!    call is `extern "C"`; both sides wrap dispatch in `catch_unwind`
//!    (abort-on-unwind / log-and-drop). A poisoned mutex or panicking emitter
//!    cannot unwind into the other side.
//!
//! ## Lifetime: the 4-function handle
//!
//! A registered tool drives an execution through **four** plugin-exported
//! functions (see [`ToolExecuteFn`] / [`ToolPollFn`] / [`ToolCancelFn`] /
//! [`ToolDestroyFn`]) — `execute`→[`StepHandle`] (plugin-allocates), `poll`
//! (non-blocking, **borrows** the handle, returns [`StepResult`]), `cancel`
//! (sets an internal `AtomicBool` flag; **idempotent; does NOT free;
//! thread-safe**), `destroy` (frees; **idempotent; called exactly once by the
//! blocking driver**). `cancel` ≠ `destroy`: conflating them is a UAF /
//! double-free. The adapter's blocking driver calls `poll` in a loop until
//! `Done`/`Err`, forwards `Pending` partials, and calls `destroy` once on exit.
//!
//! `poll` is **non-blocking** and MUST observe the cancel flag and return
//! `Done`/`Err` within a bounded number of polls; otherwise a cancelled call
//! leaks a `spawn_blocking` thread forever (those tasks run to completion
//! regardless of outer-future drop).
//!
//! The crate is `std` (not `no_std`): the ABI *types* are `#[repr(C)]` POD with
//! no `Drop` — that is what makes the boundary sound — but plugins and the host
//! are ordinary binaries with `std`, so the constructor/reader helpers and tests
//! use `String`/`Vec`/`serde_json` directly. The `json` feature keeps
//! `serde_json` optional for a plugin that wants to skip it.
//!
//! The optional `provider` feature adds the `provider` module and `export_provider!`
//! for bridging Rust `evo_ai::Provider` implementations to this ABI. It alone
//! enables the AI, async and HTTP dependencies; the default ABI SDK stays light.
