//! B5a — the plugin→host `runtime_action` bridge (inverted FFI).
//!
//! A plugin invokes `PluginApi::runtime_action` to drive the harness (send a
//! message, switch models, fork a session, reload extensions, …). Unlike the
//! register trampolines — which run synchronously inside the selected register
//! entrypoint
//! and recover host state via the thread-local `CURRENT_HOST_API` —
//! `runtime_action` is called post-register, either from a host tool driver or
//! a foreign worker. `PluginApi::user_data` carries an opaque, non-reused handle
//! resolved through a weak registry, never a dereferenceable bridge address.
//! Expired registrations fail safely, including candidate reload rollback.
//!
//! Synchronous tool callbacks inherit a host-owned invocation via a scoped
//! thread-local; workers forward the invocation handle and capability injected
//! into `__evo`. ChildAgent rejects registration-only, cancelled and child
//! invocations. A cached registration cannot override a child's driver scope.
//!
//! [`ActionBridge`] captures a Tokio [`Handle`] at construction. Dispatch can
//! therefore spawn from foreign threads and return over a standard synchronous
//! channel without depending on the plugin thread having a Tokio runtime.
//!
//! ## Cycle-free leaf DAG
//!
//! [`RuntimeActionHost`] is defined here (NOT in `evo-harness`) so
//! `evo-extensions` stays a leaf: the trait names only JSON + primitives — no
//! `evo-harness` types cross. The host impl (`HarnessActionHost`) lives in
//! `evo-cli`, where it can name the harness freely; `evo-extensions` only
//! carries the async surface. This preserves the documented DAG
//! (`lib.rs:10-16`: `evo-extensions` does NOT depend on `evo-harness`).
